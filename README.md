## Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analysis of Acomys cahirinus Adrenal Glands: Evaluating a Novel Model for Adrenal Research
Single-cell Analysis of Acomys cahirinus adrenal gland 

# Project Description:
This project presents preliminary results from the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of Acomys cahirinus (spiny mouse) adrenal glands. The spiny mouse is a remarkable model organism due to its unique regenerative abilities (e.g., skin autotomy, cardiac regeneration) and tolerance to extreme physiological stress. However, its potential as a model for adrenal gland biology remains unexplored.

# Research Questions:
Cellular Heterogeneity: Does the Acomys cahirinus adrenal gland exhibit unique cell populations or transcriptional signatures compared to traditional models (e.g., Mus musculus)?

Functional Implications: Are there conserved or divergent pathways (e.g., steroidogenesis, stress response) that could inform adrenal physiology or disease?

Model Suitability: Can Acomys serve as a robust model for adrenal research, particularly for studies on regeneration, aging, or stress adaptation?

# Methodology:
Data Processing: Raw scRNA-seq data processed using best-practice tools (e.g., CellRanger, Scanpy, or Seurat), including quality control, normalization, and batch correction.

Downstream Analysis: Clustering, differential gene expression, and pathway enrichment to identify adrenal-specific cell types and states.

Comparative Analysis: Integration with public datasets (e.g., mouse/human adrenal references) to highlight evolutionary conservation or divergence. 

ML methods: Here I am going to implement different novel ML/DL technics in different ways to go deeper in my investigation. Also I will try to use Foundational Models and check their compatability with my tasks. 

Good luck to me!
